# DBDevProject
 
 This is a CRUD application for a School Enrollment relational database. 
 I used Access to create the database and Python for the application.
 
 At first I hardcoded my methods, but once I figured out how to pull field names from Access, I was able to fix that.
 My addData methods are still hardcoded.
